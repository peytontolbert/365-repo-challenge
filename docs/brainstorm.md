A place to brainstorm ideas for projects.

I want the projects to be around my previous experience and projects, but a complete variation of AI applications.

Each project should deal with AI in some way, and be a complete repository that satisfies the project requirements.

Previous projects from github:
llama-f5-adapter: A neural adapter that converts LLAMA embeddings directly into speech using F5-TTS
dataset-generator: A tool to generate datasets for training LLM models
discord-assistant-cms: A powerful AI-powered Discord assistant that can join voice channels and interact through voice using advanced text-to-speech and speech recognition capabilities.
f5-tts: A repository for voice cloning using the F5-TTS model
text-sims-llm: An intelligent autonomous character simulation that uses AI to create self-directed virtual beings. The character makes decisions, maintains needs, builds memories, and learns from experiences.
model-hub: A flexible framework for generating, training, and evaluating diverse neural network architectures. This project automatically generates and tests various neural network architectures, supporting multiple LLM models.
vision-gpt-control: A Python library for controlling GPT-4 Vision models with images.
bob-agi: Bob - Your 24/7 Discord Assistant ( IN PROGRESS / NOT WORKING YET )
musicgen-fastapi: Musicgen by Meta on FastAPI. Contains Dockerfile.
T5-SpeechtoSpeech: Leverages state-of-the-art pretrained models to convert spoken language in real-time. By utilizing a teacher-student training paradigm, this project enables the creation of efficient and accurate speech-to-speech models.
ai-space-calls: AI Space Call is a web application that allows users to create personalized space calls to engage in conversations with AI participants. It leverages advanced AI models like LLaMA for generating responses.
swarms-cloud-agents: This project provides an autoscaling infrastructure for hosting intelligent Swarms Agent API.
TransformerWeightsTransfer: This project demonstrates how to create a Linear State Space Model (LSSM) by transferring weights from a pretrained LLaMA model. The LSSM is a simplified linear approximation of the LLaMA model's Memory Layer.
continuous-learning-assistant: The Continuous Learning Assistant is an intelligent chat-based system designed to interact with users, process their inputs, retrieve relevant knowledge, generate meaningful responses, collect feedback, and continuously improve its performance.
DPOAssistant: Continuous learning to fine-tune a pre-trained generative transformer model with DPO from real examples and a knowledge retrieval system
SinglePassTransformer: The single-pass training method revolutionizes the way datasets are loaded and processed during model training. Unlike traditional methods that may require multiple passes over the data, our approach allows for a more efficient and streamlined training process.
ConfidenceTransformer: This repository contains the implementation of a Confidence Transformer model based on GPT-2. The model is designed to provide confidence scores for its predictions, detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, and improve the model's generalization.
ConversationalTransformer: The Omni-Modal Transformer Based AGI Framework is designed to integrate multiple modalities—text, audio, and video—into a unified artificial general intelligence system. 
OpenStrawberry: An open source replication of the stawberry method that leverages Monte Carlo Search with PPO and or DPO
SOPLibrary: Library of Software Engineering Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
GCBMS: Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS) integrates a graph database with a web-based UI and an LLM agent. This system enables users to interact with and manage codebases through a chat interface.
DynamicAgent: Dynamic Agent, empowered by a Graph RAG LLM
qtransformer: Q-Transformer: Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning via Autoregressive Q-Functions
swarm-drone-hrtx: Drone swarm simulation environment operated through HRTX self attention (multi input multi output multi modality)
LLMAgentSystem: AGI Prototype with AgentZero Implementation
Ozzie: AGI prototype
AgentEnvironment: Autonomous agent environment
SelfImprove: Self improvement components and utilities
GPTDev: Collection of Autonomous Software Development Scripts and Actions utilizing local LLM
Nimbus: Autonomous Self Improving GPT Assistant
